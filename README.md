# BCI-IV

Brain Computer Interfaces has been the object of my obsession for th past few weeks and I've been learning various different algorithms. This repo is the implementation of many of these for the [BCI Competition Dataset](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/)  <br>
I know, I know it's a really old dataset (2008, yikes). <br>

However, as a beginner, these datasets are well processed and have very little artefacts making it easier to focus on the implementation of feep learning models. Additionally, it has been long enough since the competition, that I can 
- Look at the finalists' codes and try to improve on them
- Try newer models and algorithms to see how they compare against those from a decade ago


I'll keep posting updates as and when I try different models for each of the datasets.<br>
Contact me for suggestions!
