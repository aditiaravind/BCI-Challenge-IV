# BCI-IV

I know, I know it's a really old dataset (2008, yikes). <br>

However, as a beginner, these datasets are well processed and have very little artefacts. Additionally, it has been long enough since the competition, that I can 
- Look at the finalists' codes and try to improve on them
- Try newer models and algorithms to see how they compare against those from a decade ago

Check out the BCI Competitions Page [here](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/)  <br>


I'll keep posting updates as and when I try different models for each of the datasets.<br>
Contact me for suggestions!
